# Creating glass material for 3D shapes in visionOS

This sample demonstrates how you can create and display 3D shapes with adjustable glass materials, including modifiable roughness and refraction, in your visionOS app with Reality Composer Pro.

For more information about the app and how it works, see [Creating glass material for 3D shapes in visionOS][link-to-sample] in the developer documentation.
