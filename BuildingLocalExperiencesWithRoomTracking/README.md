# Building local experiences with room tracking
Use room tracking in visionOS to provide custom interactions with physical spaces.

This sample allows your app to keep track of rooms as discrete, identifiable places so you can provide a customized virtual experience inside a specific room, and also get notified when someone enters or leaves the room. These customizations can be as simple as knowing when to stop room-specific animations, or supporting the creation of location-specific virtual content such as in-game treasures, effects, or even portals to virtual worlds that contain other content. To learn more about the features that this sample implements, see [Building local experiences with room tracking](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/visionos/building_local_experiences_with_room_tracking).

> Features in this sample that rely on ARKit only run on device, not in Simulator.
