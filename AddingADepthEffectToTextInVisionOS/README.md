# Adding a depth effect to text in visionOS

This sample demonstrates how to create a depth effect so that text appears to extrude from a SwiftUI window. By using the `ZStack` function in visionOS, you can layer multiple text views on top of each other to create 3D content.

The app draws a single line of text and loops multiple iterations of the text input in a `ZStack`, so that the text extends outwards towards the user.
