# Combining 2D and 3D views in an immersive app

This sample code project uses a variety of frameworks to create both 2D and 3D views, and places them relative to each other in an immersive space. It also illustrates how to position an attachment at the location of a tap gesture.

For more information about the app and how it works, see [Combining 2D and 3D views in an immersive app] (https://developer.apple.com/documentation/realitykit/combining-2d-and-3d-views-in-an-immersive-app).
