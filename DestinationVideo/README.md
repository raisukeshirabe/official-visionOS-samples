# Destination Video

Destination Video is a multiplatform video-playback SwiftUI app for iOS, iPadOS, macOS, tvOS, and visionOS. It demonstrates how to use SwiftUI features, such as tab navigation and window customization, to create an engaging playback experience that's native to each platform. This sample also demonstrates how to use SwiftData to persist app data. 

In visionOS, the sample demonstrates how to play video within a custom environment configured with Reality Composer Pro. It also uses the Group Activities framework to enable shared viewing experiences.

For more information about the app and how it works, see
